From the given data, we can see that the feature "RoomService" is a continuous feature with mean values provided for different intervals. The interval that contains 6176.67 is not explicitly listed in the JSON object, so we need to determine the mean value at this point by interpolation.

The interval that contains 6176.67 falls between "(3249.5, 14327.0)" and "(3006.0, 3196.5)". To estimate the mean value at 6176.67, we can perform linear interpolation using the mean values at the boundaries of these intervals.

Let's calculate the interpolated mean value at 6176.67:
- For the interval "(3249.5, 14327.0)":
  - Lower bound: 3249.5, Mean: -4.146
- For the interval "(3006.0, 3196.5)":
  - Upper bound: 3196.5, Mean: -2.984

Now, we can interpolate the mean value at 6176.67 using linear interpolation:
\[ \text{Interpolated mean} = \frac{(6176.67 - 3196.5) \times (-4.146) + (3249.5 - 6176.67) \times (-2.984)}{3249.5 - 3196.5} \]

Calculating the interpolated mean value at 6176.67:
\[ \text{Interpolated mean} = \frac{(6176.67 - 3196.5) \times (-4.146) + (3249.5 - 6176.67) \times (-2.984)}{3249.5 - 3196.5} \]
\[ \text{Interpolated mean} = \frac{(2980.17) \times (-4.146) + (-2927.17) \times (-2.984)}{53} \]
\[ \text{Interpolated mean} = \frac{(-12380.77) + (8736.77)}{53} \]
\[ \text{Interpolated mean} = \frac{-3644}{53} \]
\[ \text{Interpolated mean} \approx -68.77 \]

Therefore, the estimated mean value of the graph at 6176.67 is approximately -68.77.

- Mean value for the interval "(0.0008948, 0.001092)" is 0.2818.

Therefore, the mean value of the graph at 0.0 is 0.2818.
SOLUTION:  0.2818

LLM RESPONSE:  To find the mean value of the graph at 9.36, we need to determine the interval in which 9.36 falls and then extract the corresponding mean value from the provided data.

Given that the intervals in the graph are in increments of 1 (e.g., "(0.0, 0.5)", "(0.5, 1.5)", etc.), we can see that 9.36 falls within the interval "(9.5, 10.5)".

From the provided data:
- Mean value for the interval "(9.5, 10.5)": 0.02782

Therefore, the mean value of the graph at 9.36 is 0.02782.
SOLUTION:  0.0237
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LLM RESPONSE:  To find the mean value of the graph at 0.37, we need to look at the interval that includes 0.37. In this case, the interval that includes 0.37 is "(0.35, 0.45)".

From the given data:
- Mean value for the interval "(0.35, 0.45)" is 7.27.

Therefore, the mean value of the graph at 0.37 is 7.27.
SOLUTION:  7.27
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LLM RESPONSE:  To find the mean value of the graph at 1.58, we need to identify the interval that includes the value 1.58. 

From the given data, we can see that the intervals are defined as follows:
- "(1.5, 2.5)": -0.01613

Since 1.58 falls within the interval "(1.5, 2.5)", the mean value of the graph at 1.58 is -0.01613.
SOLUTION:  -0.01613
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LLM RESPONSE:  To find the mean value of the graph at 37.49, we need to identify the interval that includes this value. 

The interval "(36.5, 39.0)" includes the value 37.49. 

From the provided data:
- Mean value for the interval "(36.5, 39.0)" is 0.48.

Therefore, the mean value of the graph at 37.49 is 0.48.
SOLUTION:  0.48
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LLM RESPONSE:  To find the mean value of the graph at 52.67, we need to identify the interval that includes the value 52.67. 

From the given data, we can see that the interval "(30.5, 52.0)" includes the value 52.67. 

In this interval, the mean value is 5.56.

Therefore, the mean value of the graph at 52.67 is 5.56.
SOLUTION:  3.38
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LLM RESPONSE:  To find the mean value of the graph at 34.12, we need to identify the interval in which 34.12 falls and then determine the corresponding mean value within that interval.

From the provided data, we can see that the intervals are as follows:
- "(32.985, 34.730000000000004)": 0.081
- "(34.730000000000004, 41.21)": 0.188

Since 34.12 falls within the interval "(32.985, 34.730000000000004)", the mean value of the graph at 34.12 is 0.081.
SOLUTION:  0.081
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LLM RESPONSE:  To find the mean value of the graph at 1886.32, we need to identify the interval in which 1886.32 falls and then determine the corresponding mean value.

From the provided data, we can see that the intervals are defined as follows:
- "(1846.0, 1862.0)": 3.823
- "(1862.0, 1881.5)": -1.36

Since 1886.32 falls between 1862.0 and 1881.5, the mean value of the graph at 1886.32 would be -1.36.
SOLUTION:  4.781
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LLM RESPONSE:  To find the mean value of the graph at 0.92, we need to look at the intervals provided in the JSON object for the feature "radius_se". 

The interval that includes 0.92 is "(0.7562, 0.9131)" with a mean value of 0.594. 

Therefore, the mean value of the graph at 0.92 is 0.594.
SOLUTION:  0.683
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LLM RESPONSE:  To find the mean value of the graph at 0.57, we need to look at the intervals provided in the JSON object for the feature "compactness_worst."

The interval that includes 0.57 is "(0.54825, 0.5892999999999999)", and the mean value for this interval is 0.4651.

Therefore, the mean value of the graph at 0.57 for the feature "compactness_worst" is 0.4651.
SOLUTION:  0.4651
